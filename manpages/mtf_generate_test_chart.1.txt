NAME
----
mtf_generate_test_chart - generate test charts for evaluating lens sharpness

SYNOPSIS
--------
*mtf_generate_test_chart* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*mtf_generate_test_chart* generates scalable vector graphics (SVG) files containing test charts for 
evaluating digital camera lens performance (sharpness) as well as autofocus accuracy / fine-tuning.
*mtf_generate_test_chart*  should be used to generate suitable test charts
for use with the *mtf_mapper* tool.

OPTIONS
-------
*-o* 'filename'::
Specify output file name

*-s* 'a4|A4|a3|A3|a2|A2|a1|A1|a0|A0'::
Specify page size of the chart

*-c* 'perspective|grid'::
Specify chart type. The *perspective* chart is for evaluating autofocus
behaviour, and is intended to be photographed at an angle, typically 45
degrees. The "grid" chart is intended to evaluate lens sharpness across the
focal plane, and should be photographed perpendiculary.

*-d* 'distance'::
Specify the desired viewing distance from the chart for perspective mode.
Distance is in mm, measured from the reference edge on the chart, to the
camera focal plane.

*-h*::
Displays usage information

BUGS
----
In theory, the perspective chart can be corrected so that the perspective
distortion is cancelled perfectly when the chart is photographed from the
correct distance. This ensures that all the rectangles appear as squares in
the photograph; however, this is not required for *mtf_mapper*
to work correctly. Currently, the perspective distortion and optimal
distance is fixed in the source code.
